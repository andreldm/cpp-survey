Library dependencies they haven't modified are obtained by a long apt-get install type command (so they're using the system package manager). Dependencies they've modified are downloaded as part of the build, obviously a lot of effort gone into this.

I've never tried a C++ package manager, I tend to use system packages. This tends to work okay as the libraries I use are stable, and it doesn't matter if, say, Ubuntu is a couple of versions behind.

Sometimes I use CMake's ""external project"" feature http://www.kitware.com/media/html/BuildingExternalProjectsWithCMake2.8.html which will download another project and build it as part of your project's build (e.g. download & compile gtest). It works especially well when the external project is also a CMake project.","","Yes","No","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

A good package manager is quite intuitive and has essentially no learning curve at all; though it would be nice to have some sort of unified interface for package management between languages, the disparities have never posed a problem for me.

The big advantage of language-specific package managers is that they can integrate much better with build systems. When working on projects in JavaScript and Rust, I've always found that everything ""just works"" thanks to npm and Cargo. Those tools don't leave their guts hanging out, so to speak. You don't have four different layers of tools writing files into your directories for each other in formats that were originally meant to be written by humans. In addition, I've never had to or even been tempted to install a dependency globally when using either of those languages. Being able to manage individual modules completely independently of each other is important to me.","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","","I would not feel comfortable, but I would not hold back the project's start","","Custom script to fetch and install libraries","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Neither agree nor disagree","Strongly agree","Agree","Strongly agree","Strongly agree","I would most likely already use a C++ package manager, but I haven't created a project of my own in the language since I was 13 or so.

As long as you have a C++ development environment and the proper OpenGL drivers installed, it handles everything on its own.  I think the nature of this project would be unfit for replacing the git submodules with a form of package management, as part of the reason NanoGUI exists is to streamline the process and provide certain guarantees.  For example, if memory serves me, there was a while there that GLFW was intentionally not updated because there was a critical bug that was merged to master as well as hosted in the package manager repositories.  This could be solved with a package manager allowing a specific version of the package, but that becomes more of a burden on the maintainers.

In short: NanoGUI is not my project, but I would be surprised if the owner made a switch.  Myself, I'm very open to testing out package managers for C++, but I am more concerned with cross platform support.  So really, until Windows joins the rest of the world, it doesn't seem feasible.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

In the Linux world the preferred way to install any package is using system package manager. The drawback of system PM is that the system repository usually contains one stable and well-tested (with particular OS distributive) package version. The language-specific package manager allows getting some specific version, also non-stable most recent one.

They could help to relax coding rules, e.g. conservatism regarding the introduction of new dependencies to a project.

In my opinion, a good C++ package manager

* is able to build packages from source (the project only stores configuration files describing how to fetch, configure, build, and install dependencies)
* avoids unnecessary rebuilds of packages (caching and sharing of binaries)
* does not make any assumptions about the underlying build system
* does not make any assumptions about the preferred IDEs of the developers
* is a multi-platform solution
* is itself an open-source project
* allows private-only package repositories, e.g. in an internal network of a company

I'm not familiar with most of the package managers mentioned in thies survey, but most of the above requirements are met by Hunter.","","Yes","Yes","No","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

Along with language-specific package managers, it is becoming more and more common to statically link dependencies into each program, making it difficult and tedious to update all programs that depend on a compromised version of a particular library.

They pose a security threat, because
1) the code is often updated and not vetted. Thousands of maintainers. Any of them can upload an update at any time, and it's immediately available to the world, without any verification. (This is unlike Linux distros, which pin down releases)
1) the upload and hosting sites are often not secure against hacking, on all levels
2) the download and verification mechanism is often insecure
3) they build on my system, adding more exploit surface
4) I either need to install in my HOME drive (which I positively hate, because it's for data, not executables) or I need to run the package manager as root (bad)

Furthermore, they make a mess, because half the libs are system-wide and the other half is custom-installed, and I never know which one will be used, creating a mess or at least a confusion.
I expect all dependencies to be installable by apt-get. If absolutely necessary, I can add a specific apt repository for e.g. node or perl (1 per language), but it hold up to the same security standards as the Linux distro.","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","System package manager","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","Bad security","It is not a problem, this can be handled without a tool","","System package manager","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Strongly disagree","Disagree","Strongly disagree","Disagree","Disagree","The most important for building a project are a) great build instructions and b) using only libraries that are in all common distros and easy to install.

I hate to have to run code for build dependencies. That code

This means there is a strong bias towards building it with the other tools in the toolchain (e.g. linkers, backend code generators) from scratch.

A package manager requires that *someone* maintains a repository and this someone is in control what package is in the repository and what not. (Reading further, ""decentralized repository"" make doubt whether the last sentence is true, but the following still holds:) I would only trust such a package manager, if it was stadardized. The availability of such a package manager might make users avoiding libraries that are not in the repository. The Linux repositories for the popular libraries are enough and what is missing can be added. However, also there people sometimes avoid libraries that are not in their Linux repository.

Also, a software project can add the code of 3rd party libraries to their code base and control in which version it is in. This gives them control and simplifies the build process for the users. As example minetest can be mentioned here, although a user can benefit from having libraries like luajit preinstalled. But if not the basic libraries are inside. I have to admit that I contributed only once to the project and do not know how complicated it was to set it up.","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","standardized","Yes","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","not-standardized","It is not a problem, this can be handled without a tool","","System package manager","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Strongly disagree","Strongly disagree","Disagree","Strongly disagree","Neither agree nor disagree","I am not involved in the build system for minetest. However, in a personal project we currently discuss how to handle 3rd party libraries. For Linux it is not a problem at all. But for Windows, which I do not use, it is extremely complicated for the following reasons. The availability of compilers is very bad. It is hard to find a recent gcc for windows, which is also installable behind a (non-transparent) proxy server. Then for some libraries (e. g. GDAL) in Windows MSYS is required (which excludes cygwin). Others have tiny bugs, which requires to fix a standard header by hand. This is not reasonable for users. Similarly, OpenMP is not available for every compiler. For some compilers a xmlversion.h is missing, although the library is available. And clang is not supported by boost on windows. So for windows a package manager would eventually help, but more important is a good gcc with MSYS. However, I might try one of the mentioned package mangers. I have no experience with it yet. Maybe I change my mind (in that case sorry for the answers).","","No","No","No",""

b) considering how fragmented distro-specific package managers are, I think that language specific build tools are actually more portable/cross-os than the distro package manager (at least a gem/npm will install cleanly on any distro and os...)","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","allows bundling all deps in a release tarball so that the user of my software does not need to install the package manager","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","","It is not a problem, I could make use of a tool later","","Library sources in the repository","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","blaze is actually really great. bazel OTOH","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I know but never used this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","mpm -- https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/lisa_2014_talk.pdf","Agree","Agree","Disagree","Disagree","Agree","I think if you can come up with something that realiably allows me to create a distributable build with many dependencies you're onto something good. Currently it takes me 1-2 days to set up an env to cross-build a project to linux (multiple archs) and osx. And I have to repeat the  process for every package and dependency I add. Fixing this would be huge (and I'm not aware of any tool that acutally fixes it right now). I think if you can manage to build the tool in such a way that it only needs to be installed on the devs machine and produces (statically linked or .sos bundled) binary tarballs as well as source tarballs with configure scripts and all deps bundled (like automake) that would greatly help adoption.","","Yes","Yes","No","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

Complex and rarely used means there's a problem.  You have to invest a lot of time into learning its complex internals, and you use it infrequently, so not refreshing and building your knowledge.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

CMake is filling this gap, but to be honest CMake is garbage. GN seems to be a possible candidate, but isn't supported outside of google-chrome.

Homebrew works great on Mac for installing packages, but it's a system-wide package manager, not a local package manager in the style of npm, and isn't targeted explicitly at developers. Similar efforts exist on Linux (nix for example) but are also system package managers.

What I'd like to see:
- standardized use of a build system via a central repository, so build files can be updated independently of the project
- a package manager that uses the build system to configure and install dependencies

i.e. using ""Magical Package Manager""
git clone URL oiio
cd oiio
mpm init  #  downloads build files from central repo, saves to BUILD.gn etc
mpm install  # install or update default dependencies in mpm-packages, builds from source
mpm install additional-dependency # install additional-dependency in mpm-packages, builds from source
mpm configure  # autoconf-style configure
mpm build # runs gn/ninja etc

The idea being your source tree is your own, but build files can be downloaded and updated from the central repo. The central repo also maps a global namespace to other repositories (e.g. oiio maps to github/oiio/oiio), so dependencies can be installed, configured and built with a single command.","","Yes","Yes","No","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

- If he is a new user, the barrier of entry is MASSIVE. Not only must he learn a new language, but also the intricacies of linking and compiling dependent libraries into his project
- Because of the former, even for an experienced developer, the time to set up a new project is greatly exasperated by having to write a ton of build files and link dependencies manually
- Some libraries don't list their dependencies, or don't have a How-to on importing it to your project. Then you are stuck with trying to reverse-engineer their dependencies and how to use it in your project. There are way better things to spend your time on than that!
- Projects (especially libraries) must maintain a list of what dependencies are called and how to install them on all OS' package managers, even though the developer does not necessarily use or understand the other OS'.

If a package manager just as good as Cargo existed for C++, I would use it for everything. Think about it:
 - Cargo makes it easy for beginners to learn the language by scaffolding a new project that builds using `cargo init`
 - Cargo has one central searchable and sortable database of libraries located at crates.io. This is unbelievably useful for finding libraries
 - Cargo manages dependencies and their versions, and also locks the all the versions (even transient ones) in the `Cargo.lock` file. This prevents a transient dependency from changing ruining the build for everyone (this has happened MANY times with npm)
 - Cargo does not compile the project, but configures the compiler `rustc` to link and compile libraries with a simple `cargo run`. This is like cmake but without a CMakeLists.txt

Firefox simply makes in-tree copies of any library that is not reliably available on its target platforms, and otherwise relies on the system's package managers to install dependencies, so 1) we don't actually have day-to-day difficulties, and 2) this is a crappy solution, because the code base becomes huge and there's no consistent process for upgrading. So if I compare what it takes to add a dependency to C++ code in general (horrible Makefile/autoconf hacking and header munging) with what it takes to add a dependency to Rust (add one line to Cargo.toml), I'm a *huge* fan of package managers. But when it comes to working on Firefox, mostly other people have done that struggle for me --- they can't commit their patches until the CI system says they build on all our target platforms --- so it's not actually a problem day-to-day.","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","Yes","","I would not feel comfortable, but I would not hold back the project's start","","Library sources in the repository","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Rarely (in less than 10% of the chances when I could have)","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Neither agree nor disagree","Disagree","Strongly disagree","Neither agree nor disagree","Agree","I would love to have a package manager for C++, but in those languages that have effective package managers, 1) libraries are designed with the package manager in mind, and 2) the build system is designed with the package manager in mind.

One of the oldest examples of this is, g-cpan, which as the name implies, generates a system package wrapping a given CPAN package (as well as all the packages in the dependency tree as best as possible).

cons: almost always very difficult (or even no way) to uninstall

For C/C++ In most cases I prefer ""own package"" of all needed libraries (maybe even only parts of them) configured in my way and located in some my folder, which can be deployed on target system by my own tools/scripts rather than ""system-wide"" installed. There are only few exceptions when I will prefer system-wide installed libraries: target system is Linux and needed library is something Linux-specific (like udev or dbus) or widespread (like curl or zlib).
For script languages (Python), I will prefer library installed by system package manager in Linux systems, in other cases I will use language specific package manager.

If I can have a script that downloads tarbals of exact library versions and things never break than I'm happier than when I have a package manager that breaks the build every time someone uploads a new version of a library. I think that using linux containers for building projects is therefore superior than using a package manager without containers, a package manager can certainly help make maintaining the container's image easier.

You can see my work on building FreeCAD with Docker here: http://subuser.org/use-cases.html

Generally, however, I find that using old, stable libararies which my distribution already packages has so many advantages, that practially, I rarely end up needing to install dependencies via a 3rd party route.","","Yes","No","No","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

There is no reasonable testing/integration work going on, as with 'curated' linux distributions and classic library deployment. This leads to the non-existence of different distributions / flavors trading stability against up-to-date features or frozen lines of packages which might have reveived more testing/bugfixing, like enterprise distros or debian. Everything is basically rolling-release, and a problem with a single package can, without review, lead to a fiasco like the recent js/npm/left-pad catastrophe. Another aspect is that developers of a project will only consider a single (the 'current') version of dependencies to build their software against, which lowers portability and compatibility efforts and the ability for software to run in legacy or stable/tested software environments. This dependence on the 'latest' software also has severe negative security implications.","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","","It is not a problem, this can be handled without a tool","","System package manager","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Strongly disagree","Strongly disagree","Strongly disagree","Strongly disagree","Strongly disagree","As explained above, I consider the whole idea of a central language-specific package repository flawed and dangerous in several aspects. The additional layer of integration and security testing supplied by software distributions, and the availability of independantly versioned repositories, as well as the necessity of software packages to account for different versions of their dependencies leads to more robust, portable and secure software. This is particularly important for a systems-level programming language like C++ which often runs in security-critical contexts.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

My experience of 'magic' package managers is that they repeatedly break, make it practically impossible to re-generate bits from older / historic build configurations - vital for support (repeatability) and licensing questions, and basically are a huge regression. Sure they can put the latest 'foo' and all of its random dependencies into your project. But this is beyond useless if you can't go back in three years and get -exactly- the same bits generated for your package to support it, patch it and re-build it.
Ergo - I hate using, and discourage use of such nonsenses for LibreOffice dependencies. Either we can host (ourselves) and provide snapshots of all of our dependencies at well controlled versions which we have ever shipped - at which point dependencies are ""easy"" - or we don't bother providing software =)
ie. there is a vast tension between the easy, free-wheeling ""busk a load of unknown stuff into my package"" approach, and what is needed for maintaining real, quality, repeatable, software for users.
Unless a 'magic' system has a -very- clear means to archive, and a 100% repeatable (and future proof - ie. we need to archive the build tool itself if it is going to ever be backwards incompatible) - and restore from archive pristine dependencies - no matter how 'funky' it is and no matter what features it has, it is worthless to me, (and to most Linux packagers).","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Repeatable.

I think one of the big mistakes of language-specific package managers has been to conflate their language-specific problems with the backing store / dependency resolution problems.  CocoaPods uses Git (!), while Maven uses HTTP REST, while PIP uses something else (REST?).  It's completely ridiculous.  I want ONE server that contains polyglot dependencies in ANY language.

At work we have a C++ library with SWIG bindings in tons of languages.  I've hacked a solution together using Gradle+Nexus/Maven+CMake with overuse of Maven's ""classifiers"".  But its awkward.  I would love a standardized solution that addressed this problem.

Probably not, CMake is somewhat complicated but it does the job. installing libraries with a system package manager works fine.

> Would you like to use a package manager for C++ just as it is possible with other languages?

I don't get how this could be possible. Using Maven for Java makes sense because it installs the Java jars which are not used by the system. But C/C++ libs and applications are always system wide and it will result in system conflicts.

Never tried one.

Each language package manager has its own standards for things like version numbers, dependency resolution, security, etc. which makes using more than one language more painful than it needs to be. With the type of software I write, users will install it via distro packages (rpms, debs, etc) so any dependencies will be available in that form as well.

These days, with easy to use virtual machines and containers, managing different versions of distro packages is easy, which is one of the main uses of language-specific packages.","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","","It is not a problem, this can be handled without a tool","","Git submodules","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","","","Yes","No","No","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

Well... speaking of Javascript, I'm just not a fan of NPM... nowdays you seem to require node.js with npm to be able to build almost any Javascript ""library"" out there... And I'm not even that biased when trying to contribute, but rather as a user who can't just include the .js library he wants to, but has to build it himself first... (some projects really fail to provide a ""compiled"" version)

It's also harder to debug them and find errors...

No - we currently have a good system for managing almost all the dependencies of FreeCAD, using system package managers except for a very few special cases.  Those probably wouldn't be included in a C++ package manager anyways, so I think that switching to a C++ package manager would, in the end, not reduce the burden of maintaining FreeCAD.  But, it would take a lot of work to make the change.

What about your C++ your personal projects?
No.  When I use C++ for personal projects, it's generally just for small tests where I don't have complicated dependencies.

Would you like to use a package manager for C++ just as it is possible with other languages?
I'd be curious to see one, if it could exist.  My hunch is that C++ libraries, and usages of them, vary too much to make such a package manager practical.

I have used LuaRocks which is a nice experience, but I don't use it regularly. I don't regularly use Ruby or Python, but when I have used pip it always worked well. C++ is at a major disadvantage, basically because debian is very conservative about C++ upgrades. Many essential linux OS components rely on the C++ standard library, and many more rely on boost. So it is usually very difficult to get up-to-date versions of these libraries, unlike the situation with languages like ruby, lua, or python. The place that this hurts C++ the most is actually on travis-ci, circle-ci, and the other ci systems based on ubuntu or other debian-based operating systems. I wrote a highly upvoted complaint against travis-ci here: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6300 basically regarding how difficult it is to use modern C++ with travis due to weakness of debian in this respect. I think a package manager for C++ that can correctly install a wide variety of C++ compilers and standard libraries and boost versions would be potentially very useful for ci, but most likely it is something that needs to be integrated with the ci system. I have less interest in a package manager for the purpose of distribution of software dependencies to end-users -- unless your package manager works seamlessly on windows and linux / OS X, it's not going to be a major advance over what the hodge podge that we currently have, and we seem to get by.","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","Yes","","It is not a problem, this can be handled without a tool","","Header-only libraries","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","boost build","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I know but never used this tool","I don't know this tool","I know but never used this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","IMO the appropriate way that a project like cegui would ""use"" a package manager is, provide documentation ""here is how you can get the dependencies using apt-get, using conan, using hunter, etc."" Unless the package manager is totally cross-platform and I can use it for *ALL* possible build targets, including windows, linux, OS X, mingw, emscripten, android, iphone, then realistically I'm going to end up using a mix of package managers and manual builds from source.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

I remember this in particular using CPAN under Debian where you'd end up with CPAN packages overwriting Debian packages making a mess.

Cargo and Cabal are nice if you have purely single-language projects but they fall apart completely when you have mixed language, then you're right back to make except people will still try to keep using their language specific package manager for part of the project creating a hidden dependency graph in its own separate magisterium and breaking the entire make paradigm. (By that point you may as well just go back to shell scripts or something.)

npm and the like 'work' to the extent that they do often because people have embraced the brain-damaged container discipline where every service gets its own cut down and lobotomized replica of a distribution. Of course that's why you can't install a lot of new, hip, trendy web apps in any sort of decent way on a real system without playing with Dockerized container crap. GUIX actually does containers well, by having one copy of every package (possibly versioned) intalled and binding them together to create the workspace.

Now, I can understand the appeal of language-specific package installers since often the distributions are bad at keeping things up to date. I think a better solution might be a programmatic system that takes language-specific packages and turns them into generic distribution packages so that they can at least be managed and versioned by the same tools as everything else.","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Centralized repository","It is not a problem, this can be handled without a tool","","System package manager","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","","Never","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","I don't know this tool","","Neither agree nor disagree","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","I don't really see C++ package managers as catching on or being worthwhile. Some combination o distribution packages and git submodules does most of the work. Network effect is part of it, of course, but C++ systems tend to like to pull in code in other languages (C, Python, Go, or preprocessors like gperf, lex, and yacc) that require a generic build system. Most of the appeal of something like cargo is that you can just type and go and BANG that's it. Since C++ builds will tend toward being general purpose most of the benefit of a 'package manager' would be impossible to realize.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

I could see the use of a cargo-like package manager for minetest being incredibly helpful, as it would be able to handle the dependencies as they become required, and new contributors/users can compile the source without having to figure out library compatibilities. If there was a decent C++ package manager I would be willing to use it.

For my personal C++ projects I would greatly appreciate a package manager. A database of available functions broken down by header file would especially make early project work much easier.

I would say that a C++ dependency manager could improve the spread of C++, especially if it worked in a manner similar to Cargo.

Without having used a C/C++ package manager, I would like to note a few thoughts on package managers in general.
Firstly, I would consider the ability to have custom repositories paramount, even if there is a single global repository. apt-get, yum, and emerge all support that feature, and I find I require those features from time to time.
Speed isn't so much of a concern so long as it uses less than a few seconds of overhead to check dependencies, and use less than a few minutes to set up missing dependencies. To this end most scripting languages are perfectly capable of fulfilling those requirements.
Finally I would like to mention that a buggy package manager is detrimental to every project that uses it, so it should be made mature before attempting proliferation.","","Yes","Yes","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"

Example: There is a package system specifically for LaTeX - but it (only) works for resolving latex dependencies. When a user install LyX (a linux package outside of LaTeX), there are dependencies on many LaTeX packages. This is handled fine by the distro package manager, whose scope is much wider than the LaTeX package manager. similiar for any other sw which uses LaTeX as a (small) part.

If a distro package manager is good - there is no need for a language specific package system. so just use that.

Language-specific package managers are practical on platforms that don't have a full-stack package management at all (Windows) or in situations the system package management doesn't cater for (per-user or virtualenv-style installations in most Linux distributions), but can't replace a curated distribution[1]. For regular operation (which includes development), a package manager that accepts distribution packages allows developers to work while minimizing the risk of compromising their system.

A high-quality language-specific package manager is a good thing to have even when using distribution packages, as those are usually easy to maintain and thus up to date in distributions (I've heard there's something excellent in the Haskell area); my general impression with the package managers is that they aren't, though -- thus the ""Against"" above.

Pro particular managers - to separate repositories: language-specific for core libraries, public VCS (like github) for particular sources, and OS-specific for parts of OS.
Otherwise, maintainers of all Linuxes shall include references to all languare repositories into their lists. And maybe forget to add or update something.

Pro unified managers - to simplify installing. Just ""apt-get install cool-python-app"" and it will pull all dependencies.
Otherwise, it will run post-install scripts to pull something else. Like Adobe did years ago to install its flash player: ""it requires 0.3Mb of disk space [Y/n]"" and then, ""Downloading 10%....20%....30%...."" fuuuuu!

On the other hand I do not really appreciate if every language builds one or multiple tools to maintain dependencies. Furthermore people have to keep it up to date and fill it and so on.

And if it works nothing beats an ""apt-get build-dep"" or a simple ""apt"" bash command on the projects website to install what is required.

If it's a personal project, yes, definitely.

What I wanted out of package managers, is that they should also handle the type of compilers used. i.e. if I want to compile the software using mingw64, then I should be able to simply install a mingw64 package. Handling the wide variety of compilers really suck for C++. There has been so many projects that I was unable to compile with mingw or clang, but compiled easily using Microsoft Visual Studio C++.

The compiler itself should suggest what packages are missing, if builds failed.

This was never a problem with PHP, because PHP doesn't differ from environment to environment.

This is even less of a problem with NPM, because everything is centralized around npm.

Currently, all the package managers that I've used except for php, has one weakness, where a package needs to be compiled first. The compilation would usually fail. This is an issue with node-gyp in npm, and in the various pip modules. pip is a big offender in this regards. Even to this day, compiling numpy or scipy is a big PITA and I would have to go download a third party python distro. While I do use it daily, I don't like it at all.","","Yes","No","Yes","<EMAIL REMOVED>"
